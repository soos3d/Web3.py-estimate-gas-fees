# Web3.py-estimate-gas-fees
This script shows how you can estimate gas fees on an EVM blockchain, using a Chainstack node. You can use it to simply retrieve information to create an app like eth gas station, or to calculate how much the gas fee should be when sending a transaction using a bot written using web3.py.
